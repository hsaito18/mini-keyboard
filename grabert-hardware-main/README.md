## Features

- OLED Screen
- Rotary Knob
- Sandwich Mount Case
- POM Switch Plate
- [4 Layout Options](doc/BUILDGUIDE.md#preparation-and-layout-decision)
- 32-bit Microcontroller

### Powered by

- [VIA](https://caniusevia.com/)

## PCB

This project uses KiCad 6 for electrical CAD

### Electrical Design Constraints
- No diode matrix enabled by LQFP 100 MCU Footprint
- 32-bit STM32 Microcontroller (STM32F072V8T6)
- USB-C
- PCB Mount Switches
- PCB Mount Stabilizers
- Push-Button Encoder
- 0.91" 128x32px I2C OLED Display (SSD1306)

### Changes
- V0 had incorrectly valued bypass capacitors. Testing showed no obvious issues, but it is not preferable.

## CAD

This project uses FreeCAD 0.19 for mechanical CAD

### Required Add-ons
- Assembly 4
- Fasteners
- kicadStepUpMod

### Mechanical Design Contraints
- ~60% Keyboard Layout
- 5 Layout Options
- Push Button Encoder
- OLED 128x32 Screen
- Fully Laser Cut Case
- POM Switch Plate
- 2mm diameter fasteners

### Acrylic Sheet Stackup

Main Case Stackup. "0" is the bottom of the case.

| Sheet Number | FreeCAD "Part" | Thickness | Material | Shape |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| 0 | bottom | 0.125 in | Acrylic | ![](CAD/2d/bottom.svg) |
| 1 | closed_spacer | 0.125 in | Acrylic | ![](CAD/2d/closed_spacer.svg) |
| 2 | usb_spacer | 0.125 in | Acrylic | ![](CAD/2d/usb_spacer.svg) *with feet |
| 3 | usb_spacer | 0.125 in | Acrylic | ![](CAD/2d/usb_spacer.svg) *with feet |
| 4 | switch_plate | 0.0625 in | POM/Acetal | ![](CAD/2d/switch_plate_0.54.svg) |
| 5 | closed_spacer | 0.125 in | Acrylic | ![](CAD/2d/closed_spacer.svg) |
| 6 | colored_top | 0.125 in | Acrylic | ![](CAD/2d/colored_top_shifted_oled.svg) |
| 7 | clear_top | 0.125 in | Acrylic | ![](CAD/2d/clear_top.svg) |

#### Angled Foot Stackup

Foot stackup. "0" is closest to the case and is on the "top"

| Sheet Number | FreeCAD "Part" | Thickness | Material |
| - | - | - | - |
| 0 | foot_0 | 0.125 in | Acrylic |
| 1 | foot_1 | 0.125 in | Acrylic |
| 2 | foot_2 | 0.125 in | Acrylic |
